# LIGHTCAT Bitcoin Lightning Testnet Validation Suite

## Overview

This comprehensive validation suite ensures production readiness for the LIGHTCAT RGB token platform by testing all critical components on Bitcoin testnet with real Lightning Network payments.

## Suite Components

### 1. Payment Flow Validation (`payment-flow/`)
- End-to-end payment processing tests
- BTCPay Server integration validation
- Lightning invoice creation and settlement
- RGB token distribution verification
- Consignment file generation and validation

### 2. Business Logic Validation (`business-logic/`)
- 21M total token supply cap enforcement
- 700 tokens per batch @ 2000 sats validation
- Mint closure verification when supply reached
- Database consistency checks
- Token distribution accuracy tests

### 3. Load Testing Framework (`load-testing/`)
- 1000 concurrent user simulation
- Race condition prevention
- Double-spending vulnerability tests
- Payment queue management validation
- Performance benchmarking

### 4. Edge Case Testing (`edge-cases/`)
- Payment timeout handling
- Partial payment scenarios
- Network disconnection recovery
- Database failure resilience
- Duplicate payment prevention

### 5. Monitoring & Validation (`monitoring/`)
- Real-time payment tracking
- Token distribution accuracy monitoring
- Error rate tracking
- Performance metrics collection
- Alert system validation

## Test Environment Setup

### Prerequisites
- Bitcoin testnet access
- BTCPay Server testnet instance
- Voltage Lightning node (testnet)
- Supabase database (testnet environment)
- RGB node configuration

### Configuration
```bash
# Copy testnet configuration
cp .env.testnet .env.test

# Setup testnet database
npm run db:migrate:testnet

# Initialize test data
npm run test:setup
```

## Running the Test Suite

### Full Validation Suite
```bash
npm run test:testnet:full
```

### Individual Test Categories
```bash
npm run test:payment-flow      # Payment flow tests
npm run test:business-logic    # Business logic validation
npm run test:load             # Load testing
npm run test:edge-cases       # Edge case scenarios
npm run test:monitoring       # Monitoring validation
```

### Continuous Testing
```bash
npm run test:testnet:watch     # Watch mode
npm run test:testnet:ci        # CI/CD pipeline tests
```
