# âœ… INVOICE CREATION ISSUE - FIXED!

## ðŸ”§ Problem Found
The API server was crashing due to:
1. **Port 3000 conflict** - Another process was using the port
2. **PM2 restart loop** - Server kept crashing and restarting
3. **502 Gateway Error** - Nginx couldn't reach the backend

3. **Configured systemd** for automatic startup
