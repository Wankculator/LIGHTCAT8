## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Pre-deployment
```bash
# 1. Create deployment branch
git checkout -b deploy/production-$(date +%Y%m%d)

# 2. Run final tests
npm test
npm run test:integration
npm run test:e2e

# 3. Build production bundle
npm run build

# 4. Verify build
npm run build:verify
```

### Step 2: Database Migration
```bash
# 1. Backup current database
npm run db:backup

# 2. Run migrations
npm run db:migrate:production

# 3. Verify migration
npm run db:verify
```

### Step 3: Deploy Application
```bash
# 1. Deploy to staging first
./scripts/deploy-staging.sh

# 2. Run smoke tests on staging
npm run test:staging

# 3. Deploy to production
./scripts/deploy-production.sh

# 4. Verify deployment
curl https://production-url/health
```

### Step 4: Post-deployment
```bash
# 1. Run production smoke tests
npm run test:production:smoke

# 2. Monitor error rates for 30 minutes
npm run monitor:errors

# 3. Check all critical paths:
- [ ] Homepage loads
- [ ] Game loads and plays
- [ ] Payment flow works
- [ ] Consignment downloads

# 4. Update status page
```

## Rollback Procedure

If issues are detected:

```bash
# 1. Immediate rollback
