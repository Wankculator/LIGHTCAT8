## Date: 2025-08-05
## Branch: final-ui-fixes-20250805-014114

### üéØ Overview
This branch contains comprehensive UI fixes for the LIGHTCAT RGB Protocol token website, addressing mobile responsiveness, QR scanner functionality, and button styling issues.

### üîß Fixes Implemented

#### 1. MAX Button Styling (Mobile & Desktop)
**Issue**: MAX button text was too large on mobile, not centered, had wrong frame
**Solution**:
- Made MAX button text-only (no frame/padding) - just clickable text
- Removed pill-shaped design, now matches - and + button aesthetics
- Fixed text centering and sizing across all breakpoints
- Mobile: Auto-sized text, Desktop: Consistent with other controls

**Files Modified**:
- `/client/index.html` - Updated inline CSS for batch selector
- `/client/css/mobile-optimized.css` - Mobile-specific MAX button styles

#### 2. QR Scanner Camera Selection
**Issue**: Camera selection dropdown was confusing on mobile
**Solution**:
- Removed camera selector dropdown completely
- Auto-defaults to back camera on mobile devices
- Added `facingMode: "environment"` to scanner config
- Hidden all camera switching UI elements

**Files Modified**:
- `/client/index.html` - CSS to hide camera selector
- `/client/js/qr-scanner.js` - Removed camera selection logic

#### 3. Camera Not Reopening Bug
**Issue**: Camera wouldn't open on second scan attempt after closing
**Solution**:
- Improved scanner cleanup with proper async handling
- Reset container HTML on close to ensure clean state
- Removed complex mobile camera override causing conflicts
- Added error handling for cleanup operations

**Files Modified**:
- `/client/js/qr-scanner.js` - Enhanced cleanup in openScanner() and closeScanner()

#### 4. QR Scanner Modal Centering
**Issue**: Scanner modal content not properly centered
**Initially Fixed Then Reverted**: 
- Added flexbox centering but it broke the close button
- Reverted changes to maintain functionality

#### 5. Scan Button Emoji Issue
**Issue**: Cool SVG camera icon was replaced with üì∑ emoji after use
**Solution**:
- Modified comprehensive-ui-fix.js to store original button HTML
- Restores original SVG icon instead of emoji after loading
- Maintains consistent button appearance

**Files Modified**:
- `/client/js/comprehensive-ui-fix.js` - Store and restore original button content

### üì¶ Technical Details

#### Cache Busting Implementation
- Added version parameters to prevent browser caching:
  - `qr-scanner.js?v=1.1.3`
  - `comprehensive-ui-fix.js?v=1.0.1`
  - `mobile-optimized.css?v=1754349560`

#### CSS Specificity Hierarchy
```css
/* Desktop */
#purchase .batch-selector #maxBatch {
    width: auto;
    padding: 0;
    border: none;
    background: transparent;
}

/* Mobile (44px height for accessibility) */
.batch-btn.max-btn {
    width: auto !important;
    height: auto !important;
    min-width: unset !important;
}
```
