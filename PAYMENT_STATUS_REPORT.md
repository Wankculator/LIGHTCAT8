## 📊 Current Payment Flow

```
1. User plays game → Unlocks tier
2. Enters RGB invoice → Creates BTCPay invoice
3. Shows payment options → Only Bitcoin on-chain
4. User pays → High fees (more than 2000 sats)
5. Payment confirmed → Mock consignment generated
```

## 🚨 Critical Issue

**WITHOUT LIGHTNING, THE SYSTEM IS NOT PRACTICAL**
- Payment amount: 2000 sats (~$1.20)
- On-chain fees: Often 5000+ sats
- Users would pay more in fees than for the tokens!

## 🛠️ To Make It Production-Ready

### Immediate (Required for real payments):
1. **Enable Lightning in BTCPay**
   - Log into https://btcpay0.voltageapp.io
   - Go to Store Settings → Lightning
   - Connect a Lightning node (LNDhub, LND, etc.)

2. **Lightning Options**:
   - **LNbits**: Free, easy - https://legend.lnbits.com
   - **Voltage**: Professional node hosting
   - **Umbrel**: Self-hosted solution
   - **Phoenix/Breez**: Mobile solutions

### Next Steps:
1. Configure Lightning node
2. Test with small real payments
3. Connect real RGB node
4. Enable database persistence
5. Set up monitoring

## 💡 Recommendation

**DO NOT LAUNCH WITHOUT LIGHTNING**
The current on-chain only setup makes the service unusable due to high fees. Users would pay $3-5 in fees for $1.20 worth of tokens.

Options:
1. Set up Lightning (recommended)
2. Increase minimum purchase to 50,000 sats
3. Use testnet for now
4. Enable full mock mode for demo
