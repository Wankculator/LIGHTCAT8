# Batch Limits Fix - LIGHTCAT Website

## Date: 2025-08-05
## Branch: batch-limits-fix-20250805

### 🐛 Bug Fixed
Incorrect maximum batch limits were displaying for all tiers:
- **Bronze**: Was showing 5, now correctly shows 10
- **Silver**: Was showing 8, now correctly shows 20  
- **Gold**: Was showing 10, now correctly shows 30

### 📝 Files Updated

#### 1. `/client/js/purchase-unlock-fix.js`
Updated lines 115-119 with correct batch limits:
```javascript
const batchLimits = {
    bronze: 10,  // Updated from 5
    silver: 20,  // Updated from 8
    gold: 30     // Updated from 10
};
```

#### 2. `/client/index.html`
- Already had correct values in HTML (10/20/30)
- Updated cache-busting version to v=1.1.3
- Maintained all previous UI fixes

### ✅ Verification
The fix ensures:
- Correct batch limits display after tier unlock
- Dynamic updates to batch input max values
- Proper placeholder text showing correct ranges
- Synchronized values across all UI elements

### 🔧 Technical Details
The issue was in the JavaScript that dynamically updates batch limits after game completion. The HTML had correct values but the JS was overriding with old values (5/8/10).

### 🚀 Deployment
```bash
# Cache busting applied
index.html?v=1.1.3

# Nginx reloaded
systemctl reload nginx
```
