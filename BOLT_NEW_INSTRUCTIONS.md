## Package Contents:
Your `mobile-fix-package` folder contains:
- `index.html` - The main website file
- `css/` - All CSS files including current mobile styles
- `requirements.md` - Detailed requirements and issues
- `current-issues.md` - Visual representation of problems
- `test-page.html` - Simplified test page to verify fixes

## üéØ Copy-Paste Prompt for Bolt.new:

```
I need you to fix mobile UI issues for a crypto token website. The main problems are:

1. STAT CARDS: Remove empty space below text in frames. Currently there's ~30px of wasted space under the numbers/labels. Make frames fit tightly with only 8px padding.

2. SECTION TITLE: Change "LIVE MINT STATUS" from yellow to white (#FFFFFF) by default, yellow (#FFD700) only on hover/tap.

3. RESPONSIVE: Ensure everything fits on 320px width screens without overflow.

4. TOUCH TARGETS: All buttons/interactive elements need minimum 44px height.

The stat cards should display:
- 4,397 Batches Sold
- 25,603 Remaining  
- 3,077,900 Tokens Sold
- 45 Unique Wallets

Please create mobile-optimized CSS that:
- Uses @media (max-width: 768px) for mobile styles
- Removes all unnecessary spacing in stat cards
- Makes text fit perfectly in frames
- Maintains black/gold color scheme
- Keeps professional crypto aesthetic

Test on iPhone SE (375x667) viewport. The site is live at https://rgblightcat.com
